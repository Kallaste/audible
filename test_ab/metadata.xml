The youngest of four, the least favorite of his father, hated by his brothers, Thorgrin senses he is different from the others. He dreams of becoming a great warrior, of joining the King's men and protecting the Ring from the hordes of creatures on the other side of the Canyon. When he comes of age and is forbidden by his father to try out for the King's Legion, he refuses to take no for an answer: he journeys out on his own, determined to force his way into King's Court and be taken seriously. But King's Court is rife with its own family dramas, power struggles, ambitions, jealousy, violence and betrayal.</description><copyright>
